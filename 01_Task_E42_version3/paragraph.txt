truly healthy  one must eat well  sleep on time and wake up early  Staying fit by exercising daily also helps to keep one s health in proper check  If you are in good health  you can always work to attain more wealth  But if one is not healthy  then wealth is of no importance  Hence  we should adopt and work towards a healthy lifestyle   Paragraph on Health       Words for Classes         Kids  Paragraph on Health       Words for Classes      Children  Health  in terms of definitions for humans means a state of the body that is totally free from any illness or injury  Being healthy should be a part of our lifestyle as a whole  Good health and a happy mind are priceless possessions that one can have  If one is healthy  he or she can always work on getting wealth  however  wealth without good health is useless   Going on a daily walk  pursuing a hobby  staying fit  eating well can be various ways to maintain your health  It is necessary to live a healthy life to prevent chronic diseases and short term illnesses  It is also important to feel good about yourself and take care of your health for enhanced self esteem and self image  Good health brings us joy  happiness and gratefulness  Adopting a healthy lifestyle by doing what is right for your body hence becomes really important for us at a young age   Paragraph on Health       Words for Classes         Students Health is not just about what you are eating or how you physically appear to be  It s also about what you are displaying in your behaviour  manifesting in your thoughts and speaking in your words  In today s era there is so much competition at every step in life where everyone wants to outperform the others  be it at school or office  Students start running this rat race since children where they fail to recognize the fact that their health comes first   It is only when we are healthy that we can work to our best potentials along with our extracurriculars  Health is a wealth better than grain and gold  The root cause of unhappiness develops from greed  dishonestly or fraudulent behaviour  Thus  it is important to inherit good values within us and teach others the same to spread happiness all around    It is important to maintain a healthy relationship with everyone around us as well as with our own selves  The greatest source of happiness is spending quality time with loved ones  Hence  it is very important to spend time with our friends and family  This not only keeps our mental health sound but also fuels us with energy and good habits to maintain our physical and spiritual health   Paragraph on Health       to     Words for Classes               and Competitive Exams Students While most definitions of health focus on the fact that how weak or strong one s body physically is and how immune they are to illnesses and injuries  a new conversation has been stirring about the wellbeing of your mental health  If we go through the pages of human history  the greatest assets identified for all individuals are good health and a sound mind  What is noteworthy is the strong conjunction and interdependence these two variables have on each other   One who does not have good mental health fails to maintain good physical strength and stamina  Only a stress free headspace and the right frame of mind can lead to strong physical health  This combination makes it possible for us to see and feel the true eternal happiness which is intrinsic and arises from within  The endless and tiring pursuit of happiness often makes one forget that they also have to take care of their physical as well as mental health    As kids  we re often told that maintaining a good lifestyle can lead to the best of health  But only as we grow older  do we realise that introspection  self realisation and reflection of one s own thoughts is also a crucial aspect of maintaining good mental health which perhaps leads to a fit and fine body  The lack of this approach often leads to this gloomy thought process at times  where one fails to understand what is troubling them and what particularly are they lacking  Maintaining good health hence becomes vital for the overall core development of our personality and perspective towards life   Paragraph on Health       to     Words for Classes               and Competitive Exams Students  FAQ s on Paragraph On Health
